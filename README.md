# About the author
My name is Maria Babakhanyan Stone. I am a PhD Astronomy student at the University of Turku, in Finland.
I am trying to keep up with my programming skills to be able to tackle problems in Astronomy and also to be able to get a gig in data science, so that I can pay my bills while doing my PhD studies.
I speak English, Russian, French, and Armenian fluently.
I am also currently studying Finnish language.
My website is astronomygo.com.
